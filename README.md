<span style="color:#005f73; font-size:1.8em; font-weight:bold">🌄 AI-based EWS Framework for Glacier Lake Outburst Floods</span>  
<span style="color:#0a9396">An innovative, lightweight Early Warning System that assesses and predicts GLOF risk using a parameter-based scoring model and AI enhancements—designed for remote, resource-constrained, high-altitude regions.</span>

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
<span style="color:#ae2012">Glacial Lake Outburst Floods</span> pose **sudden**, severe threats to downstream communities and infrastructure. Traditional approaches rely on **expensive** data and **complex** models—hard to deploy in remote, high-altitude areas.

---

## 🚀 Our Solution  
A **sleek**, modular EWS that runs on minimal hardware, combining:
- 🧮 **Parameter-Weighted Scoring** (local sensors + optional remote sensing)  
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Refinement** (historical flood data)  
- 🔄 **Continual Learning** (automatic threshold )

## 🏗️ System Design

### 1. Parameter List  
1. 💧 **Water Level & Rate of Rise**  
2. 🗻 **Moraine & Dam Condition**  
3. 🌡️ **Temperature Trends**  
4. 🔍 **Surface Deformation**  
5. ❄️ **Glacier-Lake Ice Contact**  
6. 🪨 **Geological Fragility**  
7. 🏘️ **Proximity to Settlements**

### 2. Scoring Formulas  
```math
Hazard\ Score = W_1 \times water\_level\_score  
Impact\ Score = P_1 \times proximity\_score
```
- **Normalization:** Each input ∈ [0, 5]  
- **Weighting:** Customizable priorities (e.g. W₁ for water, P₁ for proximity)  
- **Total Risk Index:** Sum of all weighted parameter scores
