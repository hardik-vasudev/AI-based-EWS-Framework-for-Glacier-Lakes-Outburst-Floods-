# AI-based EWS Framework for Glacier Lake Outburst Floods

An innovative lightweight Early Warning System that assesses and predicts Glacial Lake Outburst Flood risk using a parameter-based scoring model and AI enhancements. Designed for remote, resource-constrained, high-altitude regions.

## Problem Statement

Glacial Lake Outburst Floods pose sudden and severe threats to downstream communities and infrastructure. Traditional approaches require expensive data sources and complex models that are hard to deploy in remote areas.

## Our Solution

We offer a simple parameter-weighted scoring system paired with machine learning refinements. The system runs on minimal hardware and integrates local sensors with optional remote sensing inputs.

## Key Features

- Simple scoring model with high priority on water level and moraine stability  
- Impact assessment based on community proximity and density  
- AI-driven prediction refinement using historic flood data  
- Real-time sensor anomaly detection  
- Configurable alert thresholds through continual learning  
- Dashboard prototype with regional risk heatmaps and parameter breakdowns  

## System Design

### Parameter List

1. Water level and rate of rise  
2. Moraine and dam condition  
3. Temperature trends  
4. Surface deformation  
5. Glacier-lake ice contact  
6. Geological fragility  
7. Proximity to settlements  

### Scoring Formulas

Hazard Score = W1 × water_level_score  
Impact Score = P1 × proximity_score  

Each input is normalized on a scale from 0 to 5, multiplied by its weight, and summed into a total GLOF Risk Index.
